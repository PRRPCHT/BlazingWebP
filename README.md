# BlazingWebP

![BlazingWebP logo](/static/Icon_300.png 'BlazingWebP')

Your _blazingly fast_\* batch WebP (and JPEG and PNG) converter for MacOS, Windows and Linux (with a desktop environment).

\* _If you know, you know_ ;)

## The concept

![BlazingWebP](/static/BlazingWebP.png 'BlazingWebP')

BlazingWebP is a no nonsense, straight to the point batch image converter. Convert your images to WebP (with a lossless or lossy algorithm), JPEG or PNG, resize your photos at the same time, and publish them fast on the interwebs!

## Roadmap

- ~~Drag and drop files to the app~~ - DONE in 0.2.0
- ~~WebP to JPEG/PNG conversion~~ - DONE in 0.3.0

## Limitations

Neither the MacOS nor the Windows versions are signed. It means the security checks of both OSes will fail. Don't worry! There's nothing to be afraid of. Here's how to accept BlazingWebP's first execution on [MacOS](https://www.macworld.com/article/672947/how-to-open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer.html) and [Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgcdFdQbyAE). It is just required after each app update.
