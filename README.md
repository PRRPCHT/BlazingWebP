Your _blazingly fast_\* batch WebP converter for MacOS, Windows and Linux (with a desktop environment).

\* _If you know, you know_ ;)

## The concept

BlazingWebP is a no nonsense, straight to the point bacth WebP converter. Convert your images to WebP with a lossless or lossy algorithm, resize your photos at the same time, and publish them fast on the interwebs!

## Roadmap

- Drag and drop files to the app
- WebP to JPEG/PNG conversion

## Limitations

Neither the MacOS nor the Windows versions are signed. It means the security checks of both OSes will fail. Don't worry! There's nothing to be afraid of. Here's how to accept BlazingWebP's first execution on [MacOS](https://www.macworld.com/article/672947/how-to-open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer.html) and [Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgcdFdQbyAE). It is just required after each app update.
